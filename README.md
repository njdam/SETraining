**Markdown** is a lightweight markup language used for formatting and structuring plain text. It allows you to easily create formatted documents and web pages using a **simple syntax** that can be converted to HTML or other formats.

**Some of the key features of Markdown syntax include:**

1. [Headings](): Starting a line with one or more hash symbols (`#`) creates a heading of a corresponding level.

```
# Heading 1
## Heading 2
### Heading 3
```

2. [Emphasis](): Text can be made italic by surrounding it with single asterisks (`*`) or underscores (`_`), and bold by surrounding it with double asterisks (`**`) or double underscores (`__`).

```
This is **bold** and this is *italic*
```

3. [Links](): Links can be created by surrounding the link text in square brackets `[]` and the link URL in parentheses `()`.

```
This is a [link](https://www.google.com/)
```

4. [Images](): Images can be inserted by using similar syntax as links, but with an exclamation mark (`!`) at the beginning.

```
![alt text](image.jpg)
```

5. [Lists](): Ordered and unordered lists can be created by using numbers or asterisks, respectively, followed by a space.

```
- Unordered list item 1
- Unordered list item 2
- Unordered list item 3

1. Ordered list item 1
2. Ordered list item 2
3. Ordered list item 3
```

6. [Code](): Inline code can be surrounded by single backticks (`), and code blocks can be enclosed in triple backticks (```).

```
`code`
```

```
\`\`\`
code blocks
\`\`\`
```
6. [Blockquotes](): Used to display quotes or citations.
`> This is a blockquote`


There are many other features and variations of Markdown syntax, depending on the specific implementation and flavor being used.
